Assignment #4

Introduction
The goal of this assignment is to gain hands on experience with securely deploying your
application. To achieve this you will be working with Docker, Docker compose, Docker secrets,
Notary (Docker Content Trust), and Kubernetes. By the end of this assignment you should have
an understanding of how to secure the deployment and updates of an application after the code
is built and tested. The assignment is to containerize and securely deploy your spell checking
Web service. This document outlines the steps required to achieve this goal.
Setup
Completion time â€“ 2 to 3 hours
To complete this assignment you will need to install Docker, Notary, and Kubernetes or Docker
Swarm. Docker should be available in most modern package managers, and can also be found
at https://docs.docker.com/install. Information on using Notary with docker (Docker Content
Trust) can be found at https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/content_trust/. Information
on installing and using Kubernetes for the purpose of this assignment can be found at
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/.
Deliverables & Grading
The configuration files and reports are to submitted through NYU Classes. Your submission
should be a compressed archive file which contains all configuration files and the report in PDF,
ODT, or text format.
1. Correctness: 50 pts.
2. Report: 50 pts.
 Total 100 pts.

Docker and Secrets
Finish by the middle of week 11.
For this part of the assignment, you are tasked with dockerizing your application. To complete
this portion of the assignment, you must create a Dockerfile for your Web service. All sensitive
information such as secret keys (for instance for generating CSRF tokens) and default admin
passwords must be supplied using Docker secrets or Kubernetes secrets (see next section).
The dockerfile should be self-contained, a person who wants to deploy your service should have
to perform no other actions other than building your docker container. This means that your
dockerfile must install the dependencies for your application or use a parent image that already
contains these dependencies. In order to allow us to easily grade, we require that your Web
service be exposed on port 8080.
After the Dockerfile is created for your sevice, these image should be placed in a .dockercompose.yml file. In order for someone to deploy your application, they should only need to run
the command:
$ docker-compose up -d
This would be more useful if you Web service and database were separated, and both services
were to be launched using docker-compose. However, due to time constrains and the design of
the previous assignments you will only be using one docker image.
To complete this portion of the assignment, you will need to turn in a Dockerfile and a .dockercompose.yml file.
Docker Content Trust
Finish by the middle of Week 12
After your Web service has been containerized, one must ensure that updates can be delivered
securely. We will do this using Docker Content Trust, which is built on notary. Information on
Docker Content Trust can be found at
https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/content_trust/.
To avoid pushing too many images to the Docker Hub, in this portion of the write-up you can
just explain how you would use Docker Content Trust and what it would add for your program.
You are not required to actually perform these steps.
Kubernetes or Docker Swarm
Finish by the end of Week 12
2
We want to deploy the service with many replicas so that our service can maintain availability.
We will do this with kubernetes or with docker swarm. We also want to limit our pods to have
resource limitations so we do not overburden or hog the machine our pods are running on. Our
Web service should have four replicas with limited CPU and memory.
For this assignment we assume load balancing is being performed by a load balancing solution
or by a service mesh like Istio, but you are not required to implement this due to time constraints
on the assignment.
For this portion of the assignment you need to turn all files and/or the commands you executed
to get your replicated service up and running.
Writeup
Finish by the end of Week 12
After you have completed setting up all of the software listed above, write a paragraph for each
tool explaining how you set it up (providing commands where necessary, or reffering to the
submitted configuration files otherwise) and what problem(s) the software solves.
Extra Credit
Extra credit may be granted by the graders for assignments that go above and beyond the
requirements specified in this document.
Hints
You may want to view tutorials for how to use each of the applications mentioned here.
Configurations can be complex, and following a walkthrough can help translate the theory that
you learned about in class into practice. You should also check if there are tools available to
easily convert between docker-compose and kubernetes to save some effort in setting up your
kubernetes configuration.
